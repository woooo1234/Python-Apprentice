"""
Write a Python program that asks the user for two numbers. The program should
display the sum of the two numbers.

In this program we will just give you the comments for what you need to do. Look
at the comments and the code snippets in the previous lessons, like
03_My_Ages.py, to figure out how to complete the program.

# Import the required modules

# Create a window object

# Hide the window, hint: use the withdraw method

# Ask the user for the first number   
user_input = int(input("Give me the first number"))
# Ask the user for the second number
user_input2 = int(input("Give me the second number"))
# Display the sum of the two numbers 
sum1 == user_input += user_input2
print(sum1)
# Keep the window open
